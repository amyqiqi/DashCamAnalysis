        "**Report on Object Tracking Code Implementation**\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook presents our Computer Vision final project, which focuses on object tracking within video frames. We were tasked with processing two video files, ‘st-catherines_drive.mp4’ and 'mcgill_drive.mp4' with the goal of identifying and tracking various objects such as cars and pedestrians. We used machine learning models, with an integration of an advanced object detection model, custom tracking algorithms, and a video processing loop. We also had to use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, specifically the 'yolov8s.pt' version, for the best efficiency and accuracy in real-time object detection. With this overall approach, we hoped to achieve a high-performing and responsive object detection system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we began, we made several assumptions. Firstly, we assumed the videos provided have a certain level of video quality and specific conditions, such that our object detection and tracking algorithms are optimized for these videos specifically. These conditions could be video specific or environmental, including camera angle, lighting conditions, weather conditions, or traffic patterns. In terms of environment, we do assume a stable environment, as drastic changes could affect detection and tracking accuracy. We also assume that the YOLO model has been trained on a dataset e.g. COCO, which includes the object classes needed like cars and pedestrians. However, we note that the YOLO model has limitations that also impact the project's scope and effectiveness, particularly object detection accuracy under varying conditions. Additionally, the custom object tracker's performance is likely influenced by factors such as the size and speed of the objects, as well as potential occlusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We first implemented a custom Tracker class to handle the tracking of objects. This class uses an object tracking method to track objects by their center points. When a new object is detected, it is assigned a unique ID, and its position is updated across successive frames. If an object's center point is close to a previously detected object, i.e. within a threshold distance of 35 pixels, it's assumed to be the same object. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then to begin the video processing, our code initializes the YOLO model for object detection and defines specific areas of interest in the video frame, such as lanes and parking spots. These areas are critical for categorizing the tracked objects, i.e. cars and pedestrians. We then use a loop to process the videos. The loop reads the video frames, resizes them, then feeds them into the YOLO model for object detection. The objects are categorized based on their class IDs. These tracked objects are further analyzed to track the movement and changes of the detected objects over time and determine whether they fall within the predefined areas of interest. This step is crucial for distinguishing between, for example, moving cars, parked cars, and pedestrians in specific zones. Additionally, the code keeps track of unique IDs for each category of object in different sets, allowing for a count of distinct cars and pedestrians in each area of interest. Finally, to visualize the detection, we mark the tracked objects with circles and rectangles, along with the IDs of the objects. The final output prints the number of cars and pedestrians detected in each area. \n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of software and routines, the project uses many tools. As mentioned before, we use the Ultralytics YOLO package for object detection. We also mentioned a custom 'Tracker' class we  developed, responsible for assigning unique IDs to each detected object and updating their positions across video frames. The Python Math module is used for essential mathematical operations like hypot, which is used to calculate Euclidean distance between points. It's crucial for determining the proximity of tracked objects in our tracking algorithms. OpenCV and cvzone are leveraged for video processing and annotation tasks, including reading video frames, resizing images, drawing shapes (like rectangles and circles for visualization), and handling polygon operations for area-based tracking. Then we have the PyTorch library, a popular machine learning library, that is used for handling the operations related to the YOLO model, particularly when dealing with tensor computations and GPU acceleration (if available). It's critical for efficient processing of the object detection tasks. We also used Numpy for scientific computing. In this code, it's used mainly for handling numerical operations and data structures, especially for manipulating arrays like those representing the areas of interest. Lastly, we used Pandas for data manipulation to handle data returned by the YOLO model. It's particularly useful for managing structured data like bounding box coordinates and class IDs, which is used for organizing and analyzing the tracking data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the program’s performance was sufficient. Firstly, the program proved to be efficient, as it uses the YOLO model, which is known for its fast object detection capabilities. Combined with the Python libraries we used, e.g. NumPy and Pandas, our program was able to process video frames quite quickly. The video processing took 1 mins 36 secs for mcgill_drive and 1 mins 54 secs for st_catherine. This is a good execution time considering that the videos are quite large, 61.5MB and 83.5MB respectively. However, the execution speed also depends on hardware capabilities. We chose to use GPU because yolov8 can be computationally intensive. Thus, a less powerful hardware may limit the program's usability or efficiency. \n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of accuracy, the program is also very accurate. The number of objects detected by the program did not vary much from the manually obtained ground truths. For the mcgill_drive.mp4 video, the maximum error rate was 20.5% for pedestrians. Otherwise, the program only had 4.3% to 8.3% error for moving cars and parked cars respectively. For the st-catherine_drive.mp4 video, there were only missing detected objects for number of parked cars, at 3.7%. The reasons for these discrepancies could be that the program misses objects that were in poorer quality lighting, e.g. the pedestrians in the mcgill_drive.mp4 video. In addition, the tracking algorithm also does not seem to account for occlusions, where an object might be temporarily blocked by another, which occurs in both videos. Furthermore, the use of a fixed distance threshold (35 pixels) for tracking objects might not be optimal in all scenarios. For instance, in cases where the camera angle or distance from the objects varies significantly, this threshold may lead to incorrect tracking. The program's effectiveness is also highly dependent on the predefined areas of interest. Any misalignment or incorrect definition of these areas could lead to inaccurate categorization of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, our implementation demonstrates a comprehensive approach to applying modern computer vision and machine learning techniques for real-time object detection and tracking in video streams. It is indicative of an application aimed towards areas like traffic monitoring, surveillance, or automated video analysis, using Python libraries and machine learning models to process and interpret video data effectively. It has specific strengths in real-time processing and area-based categorization. However, it faces limitations in terms of adaptability, robustness in varied conditions, and handling complex scenarios like occlusions. Future improvements could include adaptive thresholding for tracking, more dynamic area definitions, and expanded object class recognition to enhance its versatility and robustness.\n",

        "Note: we did not count cars that were stopped, e.g. at a red light, as parked cars and we only counted people who were walking/standing as pedestrians i.e. exlcuding people sitting on the floor, but including people who were even just standing. We also did not count trucks as cars. We defined \"passing\" an object as physically moving past them. \n",
